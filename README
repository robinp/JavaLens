JavaLens
--------

Small example on using Lens from Java.

Without Lens, modifying a deep nested immutable structure is inconvenient,
but with Lens it becomes quite easy.

See
---
javalens.logic.UpdateTest for using basic lens
javalens.logic.MapLensTest for using lens for maps
javalens.logic.ComposedMapLensTest for combining various lens to access deep structures

Todo
----
* MapLens creates a new HashMap on return. It would be nicer to use pcollections' persistent maps
  for efficient differential updates.
